# SketchUp Pro 2025 v25.0.571 Key Features:
Scenes Panel
Now that you have a better visibility toggle with hidden geometry and objects, we decided to take it one step further. We separate hidden geometry and objects so you can save them separately for each scene. You‚Äôll see a new checkbox in the Scenes panel that allows you to save the visibility state of hidden objects. This gives you better visibility control for every scene.

Section Planes & Scenes
Keeping with the theme of the scene, you can now keep the cut plane visible for each scene. Why? Because the cut planes are grouped with objects, we want to make sure they behave like objects in terms of visibility for each scene. Before this change, only the top-level visibility of the cut planes could be saved for each scene. Again, you need more control over your scenes and consistency.

Hidden Objects are now Editable
Good news‚Ä¶ hidden objects are now editable. What does this mean, you ask? When you select a hidden object in the Outliner, instead of disappearing completely when you try to edit your object, it appears in a grid view to make it easier for you to make changes. So keep up the good work without getting in the way of your editing workflow.

Improvements to Grips
Small but powerful feature: You can now use the Rotate tool when switching between ALL grips ‚Äì just like the Move tool! This ensures greater consistency between tools so you can focus on your project.
